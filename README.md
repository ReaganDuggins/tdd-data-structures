# tdd-data-structures
This repository is a collection of data structures built for practice with TDD. 

More info should be added as the repo grows.

- Uses Junit5 and Java 8.0

Assorted Guidelines:
- "spec" folder structure should mimic "src" folder structure, but with "Tests" added to the end of each package name.
- Commit/push passing test.
- Commit/push on failing test if you don't want to forget the next step you were going to take.
